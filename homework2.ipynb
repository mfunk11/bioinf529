    "## Coding by Contract\n",
    "We (the Instructors) promise a fair, impartial, and objective means of grading such that you (the Students) follow the tenets of Coding by Contract:\n",
    "1. You must not modify/delete any of the existing code in this document (besides the `pass` statements)\n",
    "* Your functions must use the function signatures as written\n",
    "* Your functions must return/print the expected results (as written)\n",
    "\n",
    "If these are followed correctly, your submission should be compatible with the automated testing suite. Therefore, the more tests your code passes, the less scrutiny your code will be under by our review. We do not care *how* you get there, just that you get there *correctly*.\n",

    "## Submission\n",
    "Please rename this notebook to **homework2_uniqname.ipynb** for submission. \n",

    "\n",
    "We will *only* grade the most recent submission of your exam.\n",

    "## Late Policy\n",
    "Each submission will receive a **25%** penalty per day (up to three days) that the assignment is late.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, the student will receive a **0** for the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Academic Honor Code\n",
    "You may consult with others. However, all answers must be your own and code comparison software will be used to enforce this rule. You are allowed to ask questions at office hours but the answers given will be high-level/conceptual in nature.\n"

In this section of the test, we will implement methods for identifying deletions using a CIGAR string. To accomplish this, we will first implement a method to decode CIGAR strings.
